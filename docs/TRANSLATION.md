### How to make dictionay and tipitaka websites support my language?

Answer: Fetch this [Traditional Chinese po file](https://github.com/siongui/pali/blob/master/common/locale/zh_TW/LC_MESSAGES/messages.po) to your computer. Lines that starts with <em>msgid</em> are the English texts, and Lines that starts with <em>msgstr</em> are corresponding translated texts of your language. If you want the website to support your language, put translated texts here. Then make pull requests at the [pali repository](https://github.com/siongui/pali) on the github, or mail the po file to me (siongui@gmail.com). It is recommended to release your translation in public domain.

Note: Your translated po file must be put in appropriate [locale](http://www.roseindia.net/tutorials/I18N/locales-list.shtml) directory. For example, the po file contains Vietnamese translation must be put in <strong>common/locale/vi_VN/LC_MESSAGES/messages.po</strong>, and the po file contains French translation must be put in <strong>common/locale/fr_FR/LC_MESSAGES/messages.po</strong>.
