### How to translate the canon title to my language on tipitaka website?

Answer: First take a look at this file: [tipitaka/setup/setTranslationData.py](https://github.com/siongui/pali/blob/master/tipitaka/setup/setTranslationData.py). I will use Traditional Chinese as example. In this file, there is a variable named <em>canonTextTranslation['zh_TW']</em>, inside this variable, the left side are pali texts, and the right side are translated texts. Create a variable with [your language locale](http://www.roseindia.net/tutorials/I18N/locales-list.shtml) and follow the same format to translate pali texts to your language. Then make pull request at the [pali](https://github.com/siongui/pali) repository on the github, or mail the translation to the author (siongui@gmail.com). It is recommended to release your translation in public domain.
