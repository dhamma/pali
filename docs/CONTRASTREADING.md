### How to add more contrast (parallel) readings for tipitaka website?

Answer: It is actually very easy to add more contrast readings of some specific language because this feature has been put in first priority in the beginning. First take a look at [CSCD directory](https://github.com/siongui/data/tree/master/pali/common/romn/cscd) at [data](https://github.com/siongui/data) repository. This directory contains all the Roman pali texts released by [The Pali Tipitaka](http://www.tipitaka.org/). The xml files in this directory are the <em>base</em> format of the translation. Then take a look at [translation directory](https://github.com/siongui/data/tree/master/pali/common/translation) at [data](https://github.com/siongui/data) repository. All available translations are sorted according to lagnauges, then sorted by translators in sub-directories.

I will use the first chapter [Yamakavaggo](https://github.com/siongui/data/blob/master/pali/common/romn/cscd/s0502m.mul0.xml) of Dhammapada as example. One of the traditional chinese translation is available [here](https://github.com/siongui/data/blob/master/pali/common/translation/zh_TW/2/s0502m.mul0.xml). Take a look at the original pali texts and translated texts. You will find the texts inside the <em>p</em> tag are 1-to-1 mapping. So if you want to add contrast reading of Yamakavaggo of some specifice language, you can replace the texts inside the <em>p</em> tag with corresponding translated texts of the language. If translation of some lines are not available. Just leave the origianl pali texts unchanged. After finished, make a pull requests on [data](https://github.com/siongui/data) repository, or mail the translated xml file to me (siongui@gmail.com). It is recommended to release your work in public domain.
